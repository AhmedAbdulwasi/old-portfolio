# My Portfolio
This is a new up-to-date portfolio that I created with multiple pages instead of one singular page that includes Home, About, Experience and Projects. This project uses plain HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. You can access the website here: https://ahmedabdulwasi.github.io/portfolio/

A place where I can talk about myself and showcase my abilities. Also at the same time, I gained more experience in web development.


## Languages and Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (a little bit)

        <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p style="text-indent: 2em;">My name is Ahmed Bein and I'm majoring in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/science/" target="_blank">Faculty of Science at Toronto Metropolitan University</a> (formerly Ryerson University).
I first majored in Business Technology Management from 2022-23 as a first-year and during that time, I was heavily involved in extracurricular activities such as technical bootcamps, programs such as DataWorks, leading other first-year students and more.
This level of dedication outside of my classes earned me the Top 10% Most Engaged Student and other awards and scholarships. It also incredibly helped my social skills such as teamwork, communication skills, interpersonal skills and much more.</p>
<br><br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Additionally, I enrolled myself in a Computer Science course called "Computer-Enabled Problem Solving" and I loved it with all my heart. I was already interested in Computer Science but I never realized that it was a <strong>passion</strong> until I began to spend a large amount of my free time learning more about programming, algorithms, software development life cycle, problem-solving and much more through extracurricular activities, educational videos/courses, and more. So I transferred and ever since, I never regretted that moment.</p>
<br><br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I'm actually interested in a lot of technical positions that make it difficult to choose which path I should focus on but I'm heavily leaning towards <strong>software development/engineering</strong> as it uses programming languages, algorithms, method approaches and much more that highly interests me. Other topics/areas that interest me are Machine learning, artificial Intelligence, quantum computing, data analysis and more. Outside of that, I like to play video games, workout, chess, Soccer/Football, and watch Movies and Tv shows/series. </p>
